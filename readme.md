# TREYESCAN â€“ Events Classifier v1.0.0

This repo contains the code for classifying gaze data from [treyescan/dynamic-aoi-toolkit](https://github.com/treyescan/dynamic-aoi-toolkit). For the classification, a slightly modified version of [psychoinformatics-de/remodnav](https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/remodnav) is used. Refer to the publication for an explanation of this adaptation. The adapted code can be found in `/remodnav-adapation`.

## Installation

To use the gaze classifier, make sure python3 is installed. To install the latest version of this repo, use:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:treyescan/gaze-classifier.git

cd gaze-classifier

pip3 install -m requirements.txt

cp __constants.example.py __constants.py 
# copy example config file; make sure to edit the variables for your system
```

## Example usage

### 1. Multi REMoDNaV

When classifying gaze, you will mainly use the `multi-remodnav.py`, as this is the most efficient (multi threaded) way to quickly analyse multiple participants or trials.

The script will search in `input_folder` (set in `__constants.py`) for `gp.csv`. These files are the result of [treyescan/dynamic-aoi-toolkit](https://github.com/treyescan/dynamic-aoi-toolkit) and contain processed gaze data from the Pupil Labs Eye Trackers.

> NB: The gaze classifier assumes the same data folder structure as [treyescan/dynamic-aoi-toolkit](https://github.com/treyescan/dynamic-aoi-toolkit)

For all found `gp.csv` files:
1. A preperation script will be called (which prepares the data as REMoDNaV requires)
1. The REMoDNaV adaptation will be called and outputs `events.tsv` along with a visual representation of the events in an image
1. A report script will be called (which aggregates data and saves visual representation which help loading data into statistical software, e.g. SPSS)

```shell
python3 multi-remodnav.py
```

1. Ensure correct input/output folder locations in `__constants.py`
1. Run `multi-remodnav.py`
1. Set a Batch ID (this ID is used to distinguish between runs)
1. Run multi REMoDNaV
1. If applicable, use `merge-remodnav.py` (see below) to merge outputs

### 2. Merge REMoDNaV

`multi-remodnav.py` runs and outputs gaze events for each trial separately. To simplify analysis in statistical software, `merge-remodnav.py` may be called. Based on a Batch ID, this will aggregrate all trials into a single spreadsheet. Make sure to use the Batch ID you provided when running `multi-remodnav.py`.

```shell
python3 merge-remodnav.py --id={batch_id}
```

### 3. Overlay REMoDNaV

To better understand the classified events of single trials, `overlay-remodnav.py` may be used to generate a video such as below:

{TODO: insert video}

```shell
python3 overlay-remodnav.py
# this will output a video remodnav-overlay-{participant_id}.mp4
```

### 4. Single REMoDNaV

In some cases, a single trial must be processed again for a specific batch. Rather than running `multi-remodnav.py` for all trials, `single-remodnav.py` may be used to rerun the classifier for a single trial.

```shell
python3 single-remodnav.py CC066 T1 task1 batch_id
```
